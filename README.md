#Rotating Sphere

I wanted to see if I could create a rotating sphere using multiple circles.
It so happened that a code along video came up in my Youtube feed to build planets rotating around a sun.

After completing that, this was pretty simple.

a slight snag was that after creating 6 circles, and setting their rotation paths, some of them continued to double up - so I decided to give half of the circles a faster rotation speed; which create the end result.

## Future Iterations

- Dark Mode
- Alter Rotation/Speed
- Possible JSON/Database integration to save settings???
